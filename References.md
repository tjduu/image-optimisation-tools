## ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used throughout this project as a tool to improve the efficiency of our programming. We used ChatGPT sometimes to create simple helper functions that weren't vital to the core of the requirements. All functions generated entirely by, or with the assistance of ChatGPT can be found in the references our references. We also used ChatGPT to automate tedious tasks prone to human error. For example, creating test cases for Converting pixel values from RGB to HSV. As ChatGPT also makes mistakes, these tasks would also be calculated by hand, and ChatGPT outputs were used as verification. All ChatGPT functions were tested to ensure outputs matched what was expected.
